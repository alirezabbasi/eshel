# TASK-0004 — Define Echel Four-Layer OS Architecture and v1 Contracts

## Context
- [[../systems/ai-native-engineering-os]]
- [[../decisions/ADR-0002-extend-wiki-into-sdlc-operating-system]]

## Objective
Capture and operationalize the four-layer OS architecture and v1 contracts as executable project standards.

## Scope
- Align architecture docs, schema docs, and governance controls.
- Preserve traceability between decisions, tasks, and execution controls.

## Out of Scope
- Full implementation of all downstream tooling in this task artifact.

## Implementation Steps
1. Consolidate architecture and contract references.
2. Sync governance and memory artifacts.
3. Validate health and governance gates.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Four-layer OS references are linked in canonical wiki/docs artifacts.
- Governance and memory docs reflect the architecture direction.

## Definition of Done
- Task artifact remains traceable and validated.

## Verification Commands
```bash
make wiki-health
python3 tools/echel.py doctor
```

## Documentation Updates
- Update wiki and memory artifacts touched by architecture governance updates.
